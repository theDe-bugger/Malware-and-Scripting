# Malware-and-Scripting
I'm currently learning ethical hacking and scripting in python! Check out some of the malware scripts I've made as well as web scraping scripts.
Check out mac.py for a python script that downloads all saved networks and passwords on MacOS, windows.py for a python script that does the same on Windows.
download.py is used to download any specific image off the internet and can be altered/changed to download a file from the internet on the user's computer through a script.
